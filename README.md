# Learning Golang

Welcome to my `learning_golang` repository! This project is dedicated to documenting my journey as I explore and master the Go programming language. Each week, I will commit exercises, notes, and learning resources to track my progress and build a solid foundation in Go development.

---

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to:
- Practice writing Go code by solving real-world exercises.
- Understand and implement Go’s core concepts.
- Build progressively more complex projects to deepen my understanding of the language.

### Structure
The repository is organized by weeks, with each week focusing on a set of core topics:
- **Week 1:** Introduction to Go, arrays, slices, functions, and the `sort` package.
- **Future Weeks:** Topics will include Go routines, channels, interfaces, and building real-world applications.

## Week 1 Summary

### Goals
- Set up the Go environment and learn basic syntax.
- Work with arrays and slices, including sorting and filtering.
- Explore Go's built-in packages and tools.
- Debug and optimize Go programs.

### Exercises
Day-by-day exercises are included to practice:
1. Writing simple Go programs.
2. Sorting and filtering data structures.
3. Manipulating multidimensional slices.
4. Implementing custom algorithms in Go.

Each day's exercises and notes are committed in the respective folders, providing a clear learning path.

## Future Plans
In the coming weeks, I plan to:
- Dive deeper into Go’s concurrency model with goroutines and channels.
- Explore Go’s standard library for HTTP servers and file handling.
- Write and test small Go applications.
